    """
    Generate a batch of molecules.

    Args:
        model: The model used to predict atom types and pairwise distances at each step.
        n_molecules: The number of molecules that shall be generated.
        max_n_atoms: The maximum number of atoms in generated molecules.
        grid_distance_min: The minimum distance covered by the 3d grid when placing
            atoms.
        grid_spacing: The spacing of bins of the 3d grid in one dimension (e.g. a
            spacing of 0.05 means each bin is a cube where each side has a length of
            0.05).
        conditions: The target property values used as conditions for the generated
            molecules. These need to be given in a nested dictionary, where the highest
            level signifies the type of the condition (i.e. `trajectory`, `step`, or
            `atom`) and each nested dictionary contains key-value-pairs where the key
            is the name of the property and the value is the target value.
            For example, in order to condition the generation on a gap value of 4.0
            and relative atomic energy of -0.1, one would provide
            `{'trajectory': {'gap': 4.0, 'relative_atomic_energy': -0.1}}`. Each
            condition the model was trained on needs to be specified, otherwise a
            ValueError is raised.
        device: The device used by pytorch (e.g. `cuda` or `cpu`).
        t: The temperature term that controls the spread of probability mass on the 3d
            grid. Higher values lead to increased randomness, whereas smaller values
            decrease randomness (by making the distribution flatter or more peaky,
            respectively).
        grid_batch_size: Determines for how many already placed atoms the 3d grid
            probability is computed at the same time. Set to -1 to compute for all atoms
            at once.
            Since the computation of many 3d grids at once requires a lot of memory,
            it is a bottleneck to the total number of molecules that can be generated
            in one batch (i.e. n_molecules). By setting grid_batch_size (e.g. to the
            same value as n_molecules), it is possible to use larger values of
            n_molecules, as the memory requirement for computation of the 3d grid and
            of the model forward pass is aligned.

    Returns:
        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
            1. The positions of atoms as a batch (n_molecules x max_n_atoms x 3).
            2. The types of atoms as a batch (n_molecules x max_n_atoms).
            3. A list with tuples where each tuple contains the index of a finished
            molecule and its length (i.e. number of atoms in that molecule). This means
            that one can use positions[tuple[0], :tuple[1]] to get the positions of a
            finished molecule (and proceed accordingly with the types).
            Caution: The list can be shorter than n_molecules, as it only contains
            tuples for molecules that where marked as finished by the model. Molecules
            where the generation was not finished after placing max_n_atoms are not
            contained in this list. Accordingly, rows in the returned positions and
            types that are not referenced in the list are the results of an
            unfinished/failed generation attempt.
