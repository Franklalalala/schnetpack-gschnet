    types, neighborhoods of atoms, labels for the atom type and pairwise distances to

    to the center of mass (use `OrderByDistanceToOrigin` transform before this one) and
    that the pairs `idx_i` and `idx_j` are ordered by `idx_i` (primary) and `idx_j`
    (secondary), i.e. the first neighbor j of i in `idx_j` is its neighbor closest to
    the origin (use e.g. `ConditionalGSchNetNeighborList` transform).
